  - Undirected Graph
    1. Implementation of undirected graph with weights
    2. Detect cycle in undirected graph using DFS/BFS algo
    3. Shortest path in undirected Graph with unit weights - using BFS
    4. Shortest path in undirected Graph with weights - using Dijkstra's Algo
  - Directed Graph
    1. Implementation of directed graph with weights
